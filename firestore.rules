/**
 * # Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * ## Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for sensitive data while allowing public access to non-sensitive information like subscription plans. The primary goal is to ensure that users can only access and manage their own data, preventing unauthorized access or modification.
 *
 * ## Data Structure
 * The data is organized into four top-level collections:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Contains private user profile information. Access is restricted to the document owner.
 * - `/modelProfiles/{modelProfileId}`: Stores public-facing model profiles. This collection is readable by anyone but write access is disabled for clients.
 * - `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: Holds user subscription details. Access is granted based on a `userId` field within the document, linking it to its owner.
 * - `/plans/{planId}`: Contains details about available subscription plans, which are publicly readable by all users.
 *
 * ## Key Security Decisions
 * - **Strict Ownership**: All user-specific data (in `/users` and `/subscriptions`) is protected, ensuring a user can only interact with their own documents.
 * - **Public Read-Only Data**: Collections like `/plans` are configured to be publicly readable but are protected from client-side writes to maintain data integrity.
 * - **Default Deny**: Any operation not explicitly granted is denied. Write access to collections without a clear ownership model (like `/modelProfiles`) is disabled by default for security.
 * - **No User Listing**: The rules do not permit listing all documents in the `/users` collection to protect user privacy.
 *
 * ## Denormalization for Authorization
 * To ensure fast and secure authorization checks, this ruleset relies on denormalized data. For example, each document in the `/subscriptions` collection contains a `userId` field. This allows the rules to verify ownership directly from the document being accessed without needing slow and costly `get()` calls to other documents.
 *
 * ## Structural Segregation
 * This ruleset uses separate top-level collections to segregate data with different security requirements (e.g., private `/users` data vs. public `/plans` data). This is a more secure and performant approach than mixing public and private documents in the same collection.
